# Breaking Changes

## v1.9.0

 + Enhancers need to be reconfigured.
 + The default resource display name is [File Name]; you can change this under [Category].
 + Original built-in properties and their values will be automatically converted into custom properties of the corresponding types.
 + When configuring media library paths, the regex match scope has been expanded to include resource file (and folder) names. You may need to reconfigure your regular expressions. ([#547](https://github.com/anobaka/InsideWorld/issues/547))

## v1.7.3

 + External components (ffmpeg, lux, etc.) can now be downloaded or updated within the application. Features that depend on these components will only be available after the components are ready.

## v1.6.1

 + The "Get cover from archives" option previously in Category settings has been moved to System Settings and must be turned on manually.

## v1.6.0

 + Starting with this version, the latest Edge runtime is required and is now bundled, so no separate installation is needed. ~~You can keep Edge updated via Windows Update, or install the [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section) runtime; both Evergreen Bootstrapper and Evergreen Standalone Installer work.~~
 + This version does not provide a one-click installer. Only the auto-update mechanism and a portable zip are provided. The startup file remains **Bakabase.InsideWorld.exe**.
 + The old analyzers are deprecated
   + **InsideWorld General Resource Name Analyzer** has been replaced by **InsideWorld Enhancer**. Please reselect it under Category - Enhancer.
   + **InsideWorld Av Resource Name Analyzer** and **InsideWorld BiliBili Resource Name Analyzer** are temporarily deprecated due to low generality and limited value.
 + The former **Create NFO file** feature has been added to Category as a configuration item. It is off by default; please activate it under Category - Create NFO file.
 + From 1.6.0 onward, each upgrade clears all files in the installation folder. Do not store important files there.

## v1.5.1

From this version, resolutions below 1080p are temporarily not supported.

## v1.5.0

From this version, cover thumbnails are no longer created during synchronization. After upgrading, you should manually (to be safe) delete historical thumbnails via System Settings - Unknown Files - Find and Clean.

## v1.1.0

### Categories
Due to significant data structure changes, all categories' ~~parsers~~ have been removed. You need to configure the corresponding [components](https://github.com/Bakabase/InsideWorld/blob/main/Docs/DEFINITIONS.md#%E7%BB%84%E4%BB%B6) and ensure the category status is ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2888789/147025320-15369813-b9dd-44e1-b268-c32938423d39.png) before continuing to use it.

### Temporary files generated by synchronization
When the acceleration path is not set, temporary files generated by previous versions were not saved to the correct location and would be cleared with each installation. Therefore, after upgrading to this version, you need to manually resynchronize the media library. See [#24](https://github.com/Bakabase/InsideWorld/issues/24)
