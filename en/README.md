# Thanks for using

Bakabase is an offline media management library for fast processing, search, preview, and playback of local media.

It currently supports managing anime, manga, audio works, doujinshi, movies, and image galleries. Power users may find it especially handy.

This project originated as my personal tool. If you like it, please star the repo and recommend it to your friends. Thank you for your support.


# Recent releases

**About version names**

1. Alpha and beta versions usually fix previous bugs and add new features, but may introduce new bugs.
2. RC versions are typically the release just before stable; the stable release is usually identical to the RC or only slightly adjusted.
3. If you prefer stability, please download the stable release.
