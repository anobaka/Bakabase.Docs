# Thanks for using

Bakabase is an offline media management library for fast processing, search, preview, and playback of local media.

It currently supports managing anime, manga, audio works, doujinshi, movies, and image galleries. Power users may find it especially handy.

This project originated as my personal tool. If you like it, please star the repo and recommend it to your friends. Thank you for your support.
